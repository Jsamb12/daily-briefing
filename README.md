# Daily Briefing (Python)

A small personal Python project that generates a daily Markdown briefing with: 
- current weather (via Open-Meteo)
- a daily focus prompt 
- recent headlines from the Guardian 

The briefing is written to a Markdown file for easy reading in VS Code, Obsidian or GitHub. 

---

## Features
- Real-time weather data
- Configurable location and preferences
- Guardian news headlines with attribution 
- Clean Markdown output 
- Robust error handling (briefing still generates if news fails)
